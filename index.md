## Projects

### Automatic Description of Videos using Deep Learning
[Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/)

- Trained an LSTM based Neural Network model (S2VT) using Tenserflow, on video-sentence pairs to generate description of events in a video.  
- The model was successfully able to encode the information of video frames and decode it to form a sentence which were both syntactically and grammatically correct.
- Evaluated the model using qualititave and quantitative techniques to measure the effectiveness of deep learning on video to text conversion problem.

### Option Pricing Using Finite Difference Methods
[Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/)
- Used Finite Difference Methods to model Option Prices using Black Scholes Model and Merton Jump Diffution Model. 
- Compared Finite Difference Methods to Monte Carlo methods in terms of accuracy and execution times.
